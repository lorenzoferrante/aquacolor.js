aquacolor.js
============

<b>A simple javascript and CSS and JS framework with a new color palette for the web. Easy to install, easy to use, beautiful to watch.</b>

For use it download or clone the repo and just put the link to the CSS file before the closing </body> tag of your html page.

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="aquarello.css">`

Now you have two methods to choose the color you want from the color palette. The first is through CSS. In your HTML add the color's class you want. For example:

`<p id="description" class="mandarine"> ... </p>`

To add a backgrund-color instead of text color, just add `-Bg` at the end of the color's class. For example:

`<div class="mandarine-Bg"> ... </div>`
